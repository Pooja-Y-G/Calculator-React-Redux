# Calculator-React-Redux

#A calculator with history of previos entries by using push opeartion to an array,

#React-Redux is a best practice to maintain the state 

#actions are plain JavaScript object that must have a type attribute to indicate the type of action performed and here it's the same.

#reducers are the pure functions that take the current state and action and return the new state and tell the store how to do.
